# WordPress-Database-Queries
Queries I use to check various things in the WordPress MySQL database. I'm a DBA, I like interacting with the underlying database and I have a WordPress blog. At this point, you can probably figure out where this is going.

Note: <br>
Don't open issues. Some of these queries may not work due to your site not having the same plugins installed (e.g. Penci)
